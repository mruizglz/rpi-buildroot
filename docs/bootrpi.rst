Booting the Raspberry Pi.
-------------------------

Fig. 11 displays a Raspberry Pi. The description of this card, its
functionalities, interfaces, and connectors are explained in the ref
[RD2]. The fundamental connection requires:

a) To connect a USB to RS232 adapter (provided) to the raspberry-pi
   expansion header (see Fig. 12 and Fig. 13). This adapter provides the
   serial line interface as a console in the Linux host operating
   system.

b) To connect the power supply with the micro-USB connector provided (5
   v).

c) To connect the Ethernet cable to the RJ45 port if it is available
   (not the case of UPM Lab).

The booting process of the Raspberry Pi BCM2837B0 processor is depicted
in Fig. 14. Take into account that this System On Chip (SoC), the
BCM2837B0, contains two different processors: a GPU and an ARM
processor. The programs *bootcode.bin* and *start.elf* are written
explicitly for the GPU, and the source code is unavailable. Broadcom
only provides details of this to customers who sign a commercial
agreement. The last executable (*start.elf*) boots the ARM processor and
allows the execution of ARM programs such as Linux OS kernel or other
binaries such as u-boot bootloader.

The config.txt file contains essential information to boot the Linux OS
and perform the configuration of different hardware elements (look at
http://elinux.org/RPiconfig and check the meaning of the different
configuration parameters). Verify the content of the config.txt file
generated by buildroot and complete it as depicted below.

In this example, once the ARM is released from reset, it executes the
Image application. This binary application is the Linux Kernel in Image
format. The parameters passed to the application specified in the
kernel=<….> are detailed in the cmdline.txt file. For instance, by
default, Buildroot generates this one:

In the Linux machine, open a Terminal and execute the program putty with
sudo rights (sudo putty), in a second a window appears. Configure the
parameters using the information displayed in Fig. 15 (for the specific
case of putty), and then press “Open”. **Apply the power to the
Raspberry PI,** and you will see the booting messages.

| |ima  | **[Serial interface identification in Linux]:** In Linux the |
| ge11| | serial devices are identified typically with the names       |
|       | /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, etc. In the figure, the example has  |
|       | been checked with a serial port implemented with a USB-RS232 |
|       | converter. This is the reason why the name is /dev/ttyUSB0.  |
|       | In your computer, you need to find the identification of     |
|       | your serial port. Use Linux **dmesg** command to do this.    |

After some seconds, you will see a lot of messages displaying in the
terminal. Linux kernel is booting, and the operating system is running
its configuration and initial daemons. If the system boots correctly,
you will see an output like the one represented in Fig. 16. Introduce
the username root, and the Linux shell will be available for you.

| |ima  | **[DHCP Server]:** The DHCP server providing the IP address  |
| ge12| | to the RPI should be active in your network. In the UPM      |
|       | ETSIST labs, there is no cabled network, only WIFI. If you   |
|       | are using the RPI at home, the DHCP server is running in     |
|       | your router. The method used by this should be different     |
|       | from one manufactures to others. If you want to know the IP  |
|       | address assigned, you have two options: use a serial cable   |
|       | connected to the RPI or check the router status web page and |
|       | display the table of the DHCP clients connected. Looking for |
|       | the MAC in the list, you will obtain the IP address.         |

Connecting the RPI to the network
---------------------------------

Inspecting the configuration of the network interface generated automatically by Buildroot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inspect the content of /etc/network/interfaces and
/etc/init.d/S40network. You will see content similar to this in the
interfaces file:

::

   # interface file auto-generated by buildroot

   auto lo
   iface lo inet loopback

   auto eth0
   iface eth0 inet dhcp
   	pre-up /etc/network/nfs_check
   	wait-delay 15
   	hostname $(hostname)

This configuration activates the use of eth0 with DHCP support. Test the
connectivity, trying to connect to another computer in the laboratory.
Use the ping command.

+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| |ima  | **[Help]:** If you run the ping command in the Raspberry     |
| ge13| | trying to connect with a computer in the laboratory, you     |
|       | probably obtain a connection timeout. Consider that          |
|       | computers running Windows could have the firewall activated. |
|       | You can also try to run the ping on a windows computer or on |
|       | Linux virtual machine. In this case, the RPI doesn’t have a  |
|       | firewall running, and the connection should be successful.   |
+=======+==============================================================+
+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| |ima  | [Question] What is the MAC address of your RPI? Is this MAC  |
| ge14| | the same that your instructor has given you? Use the dmesg   |
|       | command to see the kernel boot parameters and identify the   |
|       | method used to get the MAC address from the hardware.        |

Adding WIFI support 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Adding mdev support to Embedded Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The folder <buildroot-folder>\ */package/busybox* contains two files
named S10mdev and mdev.conf. These files have to be added to the target
filesystem. This step is done by adding these commands to the
*<buildroot-folder>/board/raspberrypi3-64/post-build.sh* script:

::

   cp <buildroot-folder>/package/busybox/S10mdev ${TARGET_DIR}/etc/init.d/S10mdev
   chmod 755 ${TARGET_DIR}/etc/init.d/S10mdev
   cp <buildroot-folder>/package/busybox/mdev.conf ${TARGET_DIR}/etc/mdev.conf

+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| |ima  | [mdev] mdev provides a method to add or remove hotplug       |
| ge15| | devices in Linux.                                            |

Adding the Broadcom firmware support for Wireless hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The hardware element included in the RPI-3 for the Wireless
communication is implemented with the BCM43438 chip. It is needed to
include the software packages with the firmware’s chip and the wireless
utilities.

1. Execute “make ……. menuconfig”. Navigate to “Target Packages->Hardware
   Handling->Firmware-> bcrmfmac-sdio-firmware-rpi” and select the
   “bcrmfmac-sdio-firmware-rpi-wifi”.

2. Before compiling Buildroot we need to add more software supporting
   the configuration of the WIFI.

   a. Navigate to “Target Packages->Networking Applications” and select

      -  “crda”

      -  “ifupdown scripts”

      -  “iw”

      -  “wireless-regdb”

      -  “wireless tools”

      -  “wpa_supplicant”

         1. “Enable EAP”

         2. “Enable WPS”

         3. “Install wpa_cli binary”

         4. “Install wpa_client shared library”

         5. “Instal wpa_passphrase binary”

   b. Add these lines to ./board/rapsberrypi3-64/post-build.sh.

::

   cp <buildroot-folder>/board/raspberrypi3/interfaces ${TARGET_DIR}/etc/network/interfaces
   cp <buildroot-folder>/board/raspberrypi3/wpa_supplicant.conf ${TARGET_DIR}/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

c. Create the file *<buildroot-folder>*/board/raspberrypi3/interfaces
   with this new content:

::

   auto lo
   iface lo inet loopback

   auto eth0
   iface eth0 inet dhcp
   	pre-up /etc/network/nfs_check
   	wait-delay 15
   	hostname $(hostname)

   auto wlan0
   iface wlan0 inet dhcp
          pre-up wpa_supplicant -B -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
          post-down killall -q wpa_supplicant
          wait-delay 15

d. Create the file
   *<buildroot-folder>*/board/raspberrypi3/wpa_supplicant.conf with this
   content (ask professors about the values to be provided as SSID and
   Key-passwd). You can as many WIFIs as you want.

::

   network={
   ssid="SSID"
   key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
   psk="PASSWORD"
   priority=9
   }

3. Perform a *make* and burn the new image in the SDcard. Boot the
   Raspberry and check that you can connect to the wireless network.

Using the integrated development environment Eclipse/CDT
========================================================

Eclipse IDE for C/C++ developers
--------------------------------

The Eclipse IDE CDT is installed in the virtual machine. You can execute
it running eclipse in a window terminal.

Cross-Compiling applications using Eclipse
------------------------------------------

How will a program be compiled? Remember that we are developing cross
applications. We are developing and compiling the code in a Linux x86_64
machine, and we are executing it on an ARM architecture (see Fig. 17).

.. image:: rpi-images/media/image21.emf
   :width: 4.98681in
   :height: 2.79236in

Fig. 17: Summary of the different configurations for developing
applications for embedded systems. Figure copied from “Free Electrons”
training materials (http://free-electrons.com/training/)

The first question is where the cross-compiler and other cross-tools are
located. The answer is this: in the folder “build/host/usr/bin”. If you
inspect this folder's content, you can see the entire compiling,
linking, and debugging tools (see Fig. 18). These programs are executed
in your x86_64 computer, but they generate code for the ARM processor.

   :height: 3.83333in

Fig. 18: Cross-compiling tools installed in the host computer

In a Terminal window execute the following commands:

::

   $ cd build/host
   $ source environment-setup
   $ eclipse &

The *environment-setup* file contains the code listed below.

::

   cat <<'EOF'
    _           _ _     _                 _
   | |__  _   _(_) | __| |_ __ ___   ___ | |_
   | '_ \| | | | | |/ _` | '__/ _ \ / _ \| __|

          Making embedded Linux easy!

   Some tips:
   * PATH now contains the SDK utilities
   * Standard autotools variables (CC, LD, CFLAGS) are exported
   * Kernel compilation variables (ARCH, CROSS_COMPILE, KERNELDIR) are exported
   * To configure do "./configure $CONFIGURE_FLAGS" or use
     the "configure" alias
   * To build CMake-based projects, use the "cmake" alias

This script when is source in a terminal window sets all the environment
variables needed to use the cross-compilation tools and add the folder
of cross-tools to the PATH linux variable.

The execution of eclipse popups a window inviting you to enter the
workspace (see Fig. 19). The workspace is the folder that contain
eclipse projects created by the user. You can have as many workspaces as
you want. Please specify a folder in your account.

In Eclipse select in the left part of the windows Import *projects*. A
new window is popup, select then *C/C++* and the option *Existing Code
as Makefile Project*. The window shown in Fig. 22 is displayed. Complete
the name of the project, select the folder with the code and check
*Cross GCC in Toolchain for Indexer Settings*.

Building a project
------------------

Once you have configured the cross-chain in Eclipse you can build your
project using Project->Build Project. If everything is correct, you will
see the eclipse project as represented in Fig. 29. You can clean the
project (remove the executable and objects) with *Clean*.

| |ima  | **[Console in Eclipse]:** Have a look at the messages        |
| ge17| | displayed in the Console. You will see how eclipse is        |
|       | calling the cross compiler with different parameters.        |
+=======+==============================================================+
+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

Moving the binary to the target
-------------------------------

In order to copy the executable to the target, you have different
options. You can use the Linux application called “scp” or other similar
applications. In our case, we are going to use the “Other Locations….”
utility included in the nautilus explorer. Specify in Server Address
ssh://<ip address>

Executing the application
-------------------------

You can run the Raspberry PI program using putty (remember that once you
have a network connection available in the RPI you can also use putty to
connect to it).

Automatic debugging using gdb and gdbserver
-------------------------------------------

You can directly debug the program running in the RPI using Eclipse.
There are two methods to do it: manually and automatically. In the
manual method, firstly, you need to copy the executable program to the
RPI, change the file permissions to “executable” and execute the program
to be debugged using *gdbserver* utility. Of course, this is a
time-consuming process and very inefficient. The alternative solution is
to use automatic debugging. In order to debug your applications, we need
to define a debug session and configure it. Firstly, *Select Run->Debug
Configurations* and generate a new configuration under *C/C++ Remote
Application*. You need to complete the different tabs available in this
window. The first one is the main tab (see Fig. 33). You need to
configure here the path to the C/C++ application to be debugged, the
project name, the connection with the target (you will need to create a
new one using the IP address of your RPI), the remote path where your
executable file will be downloaded, and the mode for the debugging
(Automatic Remote Debugging Launcher). Secondly, in the argument tab,
you can specify the arguments of your executable program. It is very
important here that you can also specify the working directory path
where the executable will be copied and launched (you need to have
rights in this folder).

Fig. 26: Creating a Debug Configuration

In the debugger window you need to configure the path of your cross gdb
application. Remember that we are working with a cross-compiler, cross
debugging. Therefore, you need to provide here the correct path of your
gdb. The GDB command file (.gdbinit) must be specified, providing a path
with an empty file. In the Gdbserver settings tab, you need to provide
the path to the gdbserver in the target and the TCP/IP port used (by
default 2345).

Now, press Debug in Eclipse window, and you can debug your application
remotely.

Preparing the linux virtual machine.
====================================

Download VMware Workstation Player.
-----------------------------------

The link https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/player_pubs.html contains
documentation describing the installation and basic use of VMware
Workstation Player. Follow the instructions to set up the application on
your computer.

Installing Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as a virtual machine.
-------------------------------------------------

+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| |ima  | **[Ubuntu version]:** It is mandatory to install Ubuntu      |
| ge19| | 22.04 version.                                               |
+=======+==============================================================+
+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

The first step is to download Ubuntu 22.04.3 (64 bit PC) from Ubuntu web
site using this link: http://releases.ubuntu.com/ . You will download an
ISO image with this Linux operating System.Run WMware player and install
Ubuntu using the VMWare player instructions. Consider the following when
creating the virtual machine: you need at least 150Gbytes of hard disk
space (in multiple files), 3GByte of RAM, and, if possible 4 processors.
The installation time will be half an hour, more or less, depending on
your computer. Moving a virtual machine from one computer to another is
a time-consuming task; therefore, take this into account to minimize the
development time.

Installing synaptic
-------------------

If you need to install software packages, you can do it using the linux
terminal command apt-get. Another alternative process is the use of the
synaptic utility. In order to use it, you need to install it using this
command:

::

   $ sudo apt-get install synaptic

Once installed, you can search and execute the synaptic program. When
you click two times over the package, it will show all the dependent
packages that would be installed.

Installing putty
----------------

You need to execute:

-  sudo apt-get install putty

Installing packages for supporting Buildroot.
---------------------------------------------

Using buildroot requires some software packages that have to be
installed in the VM. These are listed in this link
http://buildroot.uclibc.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#requirement.
You need to install at least:

-  g++

-  git

Installing packages supporting Eclipse
--------------------------------------

You need to install:

-  eclipse-cdt (eclipse C/C++ programming)

-  eclipse-rse (eclipse remote explorer)

-  eclipse-cdt-launch-remote (eclipse for remote debugging)
